            <p>Congratulations for beating Trump or False. You clearly know The Donald better than he knows negotiating, and that's saying a lot (Art of the Deal)!</p>
            <p>This game was created to raise consciousness about the incredible phenomenon that is Donald Trump. He brings out the worst of our country and has no place calling himself a 'True American' when an alarming amount of his plans violate the Constitution.</p>
            <p>While I fully understand the position his voters are in, having to choose between this maniac and Hillary Clinton, a person who felt the need to cheat her way to the nomination, it doesn't mean Trump is the only option. Other candidates exist, such as Gary Johnson and Jill Stein. </p>
            <p>Before you dismiss their chances entirely, remember that Donald Trump won the Republican primary against <b>Jeb Bush</b> and <b>Marco Rubio</b>! Remember that Bernie Sanders in all likelihood (if it wasn't <a href="https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/">literally</a> rigged) would have won the primary. This is a man who openly calls himself a democratic <b>socialist</b>.</p>
            <p>If we can get Johnson or Stein to that crucial 15% so they can participate in debates, the country will realize they have more options than two bad ones. If you're able, contribute to <a href="https://www.johnsonweld.com/15_for_15_moneybomb">Johnson</a> or <a href="https://jillstein.nationbuilder.com/donate">Stein's</a> campaign.</p>
